## Problem Statement
# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. 
# The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

# The provided solution demonstrates a working implementation of this problem, where the main()
#  function guides the user through the process of entering two numbers and displays their sum.

# Solution

def main():
    # Prompt the user to enter the first number
    num1 = input("Enter the first number:")
    # Convert the input to an integer
    num1 = int(num1)
    # Prompt the user to enter the first number
    num2 = input("Enter tthe Second number:")
    # Convert the input to an integer
    num2 = int(num2)
    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    sum = num1 + num2
    # Print the total sum with an appropriate message
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is : {sum}")


#  code to call the Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
