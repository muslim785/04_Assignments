# Problem Statement
# Fill out the chaotic_counting() function, which prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but with a catch. 
# We've written a done() function which returns True with likelihood DONE_LIKELIHOOD -- at each number, 
# before printing the number, you should call done() and check if it returns True or not. If done() returns True,
#  we're done counting, and you should use a return statement to end the chaotic_counting() function execution
#  and resume execution of main(), which will print "I'm done.". We've written main() for you -- check it out!
#  Notice that we'll only print "I'm done" from main() once chaotic_counting() is done with its execution.

# Here's a sample run of this program:

# I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first. 1 2 3 I'm done.

import random

DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.2   #ya ek probability value ha jo 0 sa 1 k mid ma hi hogi

def done():
   if random.random() < DONE_LIKELIHOOD:  #random.random hamaesha ek random generate krega 0 sa 1 ka darmiyan
       return True
   return False
    

def chaotic_counting():
    for i in range(1,11):
        if done():
            return
        print(i)


def main():
    print("I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.")
    chaotic_counting()
    print("I'm done")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
