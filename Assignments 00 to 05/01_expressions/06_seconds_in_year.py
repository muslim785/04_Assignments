# Problem Statement
# Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice print 
# statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):

# There are 5 seconds in a year!

# You should use constants for this exercise -- there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an 
# hour, and 60 seconds per minute.


#Solution

def main():
    """Program to calculate the number of seconds in a year"""
    days_in_year = 365
    hours_in_day = 24
    minutes_in_hour =60
    seconds_in_minute = 60

    #calculate the number of seconds in a year
    seconds_in_a_year = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute
    print(f"There are {seconds_in_a_year} seconds in year")
